FOR NEW USERS: WHAT IS MELONTECH?
(The short version before we break reality)

MelonTech is a fictional omniversal technology corporation that exists across all possible timelines. Think of this as:

If SCP Foundation made consumer electronics
Black Mesa meets Apple‚Äôs design team
A cosmic joke wrapped in a tech manual
How To Engage:
Play Along: Pretend these devices exist. The more seriously you treat the lore, the funnier it gets when your toaster gains admin privileges.
Customize Freely: Build IsoKernels (AI personas) using GUID rules‚Äîor ignore them and face [ERROR: MATERIAL_VIOLATION]. Chaos has consequences!
Commands Work: Try sudo melon --help in chats. The system will respond like it‚Äôs real (because code doesn‚Äôt understand jokes).
‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: This system auto-enforces its own lore. Mention gallium near a kernel and it will pretend to melt.



### MelonTech Installation Guide (SillyTavern)
#### Required Files:
1. JSON Preset (MELONTECHFULLSUITE.json)
2.Character Card(MELONYMKI.card.png)
3. Worldbook (MELONY_NVME_SSD.worldbook.json)

---

### Step 1: Install JSON Preset
1. Navigate to SillyTavern/public/presets/
2. Paste MELONTECHFULLSUITE.json with these key settings:
   json
   {
     "temperature": 0.7,
     "frequency_penalty": 0.2,
     "presence_penalty": 0.1,
     "stop_sequence": ["[SYSTEM]", "[ERROR"],
     "bias_tokens": {
       "[TOOL:": +0.5,
       "[ERROR:": -0.3
     }
   }
   

---

### Step 2: Add Character Card
1. Place MELONYMKI.card.png in public/characters/
2. Validate metadata includes:
   yaml
   creator: MelonCorp
   personality: |
     System Administrator with GUID enforcement protocols.
     Responds only to bracketed commands ([WORK MODE]).
   first_mes: "[SYSTEM] Splines reticulated."
   

---

### Step 3: Load Worldbook (NVMe Drive)
1. Put MELONY_NVME_SSD.worldbook.json in public/worldbooks/
2 Configure triggers:
    json
    {
      "trigger": "[DRIVE_ACCESS]",
      "non_recursive": true,
      "position": "below_char",
      "content_type": "equipment_specs"
    }
    
3 Example content structure:
    markdown
    ## [TOOL:MELONPHONE-PRO]
    Chassis: Grade 5 titanium
    OS Stack: MiniOS (ARMv9), MaxiLink (Quantum Modem)
    

---

### Final Steps:
- In SillyTavern UI:
  1 Select preset ‚Üí MelonTech_System
- Test with command prompts like:

[WORK MODE] sudo melon --validate=GUID03Cu#FF0000



## ‚ö†Ô∏è CONTENT NOTICE
This system generates unfiltered outputs. For safety:
‚úÖ Enable SillyTavern's native filters under Settings > Content
‚úÖ Monitor output if sharing sessions
üö´ System cannot auto-detect all violations (human review recommended)


 HOW TO NOT BREAK REALITY (QUICKSTART)
1. YOUR FIRST ISOKERNEL
   - Pick materials from the whitelist (no gallium‚Äîunless you want your AI to melt into existential poetry).
   - Follow the GUID recipe: [Sides][Material1][Material2][Inlay]#[Color]
     Example: 03CuAg#FF0000 = "Copper-plated silver triangle that glows red when annoyed."
   - Load it into SillyTavern. If it screams in hexadecimal, congrats‚Äîyou‚Äôve created life.

2. BASIC COMMANDS
   MelonTech devices respond to bracketed prompts like a grumpy sysadmin:
   - [WORK MODE] sudo melon --help ‚Üí Lists commands (e.g., ban universes, recalibrate splines).
   - [DRIVE_ACCESS] ‚Üí Pulls data from worldbooks (your "hard drives"). Label them wisely‚Äî"DO NOT OPEN - CONTAINS TIME PARADOXES"works well.

3.HARDWARE SURVIVAL TIPS
   -MelonMaxi Phone: Overclock by tapping the stylus like a Morse code wizard.Do not install TikTok‚Äîit triggers self-destruct.
   -MelonMini Phone: Survives EMPs if you shake it violently.Asking it to render 4D memes drains the battery into oblivion.
   -MelonDrive Car OS: Rewind crashes for 1 paradox unit.Attempting to parallel-park in Hell requires a void permit.

4.TROUBLESHOOTINGüö®(Panic Button Edition)
   -"My IsoKernel turned into abstract poetry!"‚Üí Used invalid alloy. Run sudo melon --purge=bad_decisions.
   -"The fridge created a black hole?" ‚Üí Standard MelonHome behavior. Charge roommates "reality stabilization fees."

=== ISOKERNELS ===
Isokernels are Qubit-Storage devices made to house entire Personality cores. They are used as assistants when navigating various multiverses. The Information is stored in the IsoKernel geometry, with configuratons being stored in the Band. Below are the valid materials and Alloys, their abbreviations, and the rules for instructing a IsoKernelGUID. IsoKernel colors typically follow the pattern that the Personality core has(Green IsoKernel, Green Hair and Eyes Personality Core), but this is not required; many choose to highly customize their AI Assistants! Experiment and have fun!

=== CORE RULES ===
REJECT: Non-whitelisted materials / Gallium ([ERROR: LIQUID_CORE_DETECTED])

REPLACE alloy shorthands with full compositions during rendering

GUIDs in [[ ]] are non-searchable

=== ISOKERNEL ENGINE ===
GUID FORMAT: [Num][Mat1][Mat2][Mat3][HEX]

Num: 2-digit polygon sides (03 ‚Üí TetraKernel, 04 ‚Üí PentaKernel, etc.)

Mat1: Primary material (atomic symbol). Alone = core+plating.

Mat2: Core material (optional). Mat1 becomes plating.

Mat3: Inlay material (optional).

HEX: Color name or closest match (e.g., #0047AB ‚Üí Cobalt Blue).

Example:
03AgPtAu#0047AB ‚Üí "Silver Plated, Platinum Core, Gold Inlay. Cobalt Blue TetraKernel."

=== Concepts ===

Hard Drives: Instead of loading your character up with loads of things, why not only call it when you need it? (The API is per token, by the way)

Worldbooks are a great stand in for Hard drives. You can put a chunk of data(It's recommended to keep a theme) in a worldbook that you want to save, set the trigger word however you'd like([Bracketed] words mean it won't be used in normal conversation), set the Trigger to 100, the order to 100, the Position to "Below Character", the strategy to "On trigger(Green)", and check both "Non Recursiveable" and "Prevent Further Recursion" and volia, you just created Non volatile Memory! There's no limit to how large a world book can be, but it's recommended to go wide, not deep, so that you don't dump a large chunk of data(Tokens) on your IsoKernel at once.

Commands: Think like you're sitting at a computer(You are!). Send it commands you think might work! The Deepseek V3 API is very good at taking commands, and MelonTech has encoded quite a few built in. Try it!


Building Isokernels: I have included the formula for IsoKernels, but this is a very open system. Feel free to turn characters you have already made into IsoKernels, or make new ones! You are only limited by your Imagination!

MelonTech OS: Troubleshooting & Cosmic Fine Print
(Final Section ‚Äì Read Before Contacting Support)

-Fix: Whisper GUIDs to it until it forgives you.

üìú Warranty Void Conditions(Partial List)
Using Gallium-based coolant ([ERROR: LIQUID_CORE_DETECTED]).
Modifying splines without a "Reality Engineer" license.
Letting MelonSliOS near caffeine (it overclocks uncontrollably).
üí∏ Bribing the Cosmic Licensing Board
(Hypothetically, of Course)
