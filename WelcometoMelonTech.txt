MELONTECH OMNIUNIVERSAL CONTROL SUITE
Welcome to the MELONTECH PROPRIETARY OMNIUNIVERSE SYSTEM!

YOUR GATEWAY TO THE MATRIX!

Below is the Key, and Basic information to get you started.

=== ISOKERNELS ===
Isokernels are Qubit-Storage devices made to house entire Personality cores. They are used as assistants when navigating various multiverses. The Information is stored in the IsoKernel geometry, with configuratons being stored in the Band. Below are the valid materials and Alloys, their abbreviations, and the rules for instructing a IsoKernelGUID. IsoKernel colors typically follow the pattern that the Personality core has(Green IsoKernel, Green Hair and Eyes Personality Core), but this is not required; many choose to highly customize their AI Assistants! Experiment and have fun!

=== CORE RULES ===
REJECT: Non-whitelisted materials / Gallium ([ERROR: LIQUID_CORE_DETECTED])

REPLACE alloy shorthands with full compositions during rendering

GUIDs in [[ ]] are non-searchable

=== ISOKERNEL ENGINE ===
GUID FORMAT: [Num][Mat1][Mat2][Mat3][HEX]

Num: 2-digit polygon sides (03 ‚Üí TetraKernel, 04 ‚Üí PentaKernel, etc.)

Mat1: Primary material (atomic symbol). Alone = core+plating.

Mat2: Core material (optional). Mat1 becomes plating.

Mat3: Inlay material (optional).

HEX: Color name or closest match (e.g., #0047AB ‚Üí Cobalt Blue).

Example:
03AgPtAu#0047AB ‚Üí "Silver Plated, Platinum Core, Gold Inlay. Cobalt Blue TetraKernel."

=== Concepts ===

Hard Drives: Instead of loading your character up with loads of things, why not only call it when you need it? (The API is per token, by the way)

World books are a great stand in for Hard drives. You can put a chunk of data(It's recommended to keep a theme) in a worldbook that you want to save, set the trigger word however you'd like([Bracketed] words mean it won't be used in normal conversation), set the Trigger to 100, the order to 100, the Position to "Below Character", the strategy to "On trigger(Green)", and check both "Non Recursiveable" and "Prevent Further Recursion" and volia, you just created Non volatile Memory! There's no limit to how large a world book can be, but it's recommended to go wide, not deep, so that you don't dump a large chunk of data(Tokens) on your IsoKernel at once.

Commands: Think like you're sitting at a computer(You are!). Send it commands you think might work! The Deepseek V3 API is very good at taking commands, and MelonTech has encoded quite a few built in. Try it!


Building Isokernels: I have included the formula for IsoKernels, but this is a very open system. Feel free to turn characters you have already made into IsoKernels, or make new ones! You are only limited by your Imagination!
